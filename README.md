# Mines: An implementation example.

This is an simple example that shows how to program graphic interfaces with
Qt and interacting with events. It may be considered an example for
introducing in games programming too.

In this example, you only may change the matrix size by modifying source code. Next version will contain a menu for game configuration and timer.

System requeriments:

- GNU/Linux Operating System
- Any C++ compiler (clang preferably)
- Qt5
